## Environment Setup

* `Python3.6`
* `Pytorch 0.4.0` or higher
* `libmysqlclient-dev` installed

Install Python dependency via `pip install -r requirements.txt` when the environment of Python and Pytorch is setup.

* download `wordnet` via `python -m nltk.downloader wordnet`

## Running Code

#### Data preparation


* Download [Glove Embedding](https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/wordvecs/glove.42B.300d.zip) and put `glove.42B.300d` under `./data/` directory
* Download [Pretrained IRNet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VoV28fneYss8HaZmoThGlvYU3A-aK31q) and put `
IRNet_pretrained.model` under `./saved_model/` directory
* Download preprocessed train/dev datasets from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YFV1GoLivOMlmunKW0nkzefKULO4wtrn) and put `train.json`, `dev.json` and
`tables.json` under `./data/` directory

##### Generating train/dev data by yourself
You could process the origin [Spider Data](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=11icoH_EA-NYb0OrPTdehRWm_d7-DIzWX) by your own. Download  and put `train.json`, `dev.json` and
`tables.json` under `./data/` directory and follow the instruction on `./preprocess/`

#### Training

Run `train.sh` to train IRNet.

`sh train.sh [GPU_ID] [SAVE_FOLD]`

#### Testing

Run `eval.sh` to eval IRNet.

`sh eval.sh [GPU_ID] [OUTPUT_FOLD]`


#### Evaluation

You could follow the general evaluation process in [Spider Page](https://github.com/taoyds/spider)


## Results
| **Model**   | Dev <br /> Exact Set Match <br />Accuracy | Test<br /> Exact Set Match <br />Accuracy |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| IRNet    | 53.2                        | 46.7                      |
| IRNet+BERT(base) | 61.9                          | **54.7**                      |
